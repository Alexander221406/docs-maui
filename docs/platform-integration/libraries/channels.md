Platform Channels are configurable, bi-directional pipes between .NET and the native platform enabling you to use in your .NET MAUI app any platform-specific library written with non-.NET technologies. This method requires a minimal amount of coding in the language of the platform you are writting for such as Obj-C, Swift, Java, Kotlin, or C++. For a fully C# developer experience, see [Binding Libraries](bindings.md).
