Binding projects are the same method used by the .NET team to provide Android and iOS SDKs to .NET developers. In short, you have a native SDK written in the language and technology of that platform, and you bind it to .NET creating an API surface that is both faithful to the platform SDK and follows the idioms and patterns of .NET. While this method does provide the best .NET developer experience, it is also the most complex approach to using platform libraries requiring a deep understanding of both .NET and the platform language features. If you are primarily needing to consume an existing platform library, consider the [Platform Channel](channels.md) approach first.
